```{r, include = FALSE}
library(weathercan)
```

When using data from external sources it's a good idea to take note of when data
was downloaded, which version (if possible) and with what. 

Reproducibility with `weathercan` can be achieved by taking note (or better yet, 
compiling reports) with the following information:

1. Your computer information (and date)
    - R version
2. Specific information on packages you're using
    - Citations if presenting in papers/reports
3. The stations list version

For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Work
library(weathercan)
s <- stations_search("Winnipeg", normals_years = "current")
w <- weather_dl(s, interval = "month", start = "2021-01-01")

# Reproducibility
stations_meta()
citation('weathercan')
devtools::session_info() # Install devtools if you don't have it
```


```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, highlight=1}
library(weathercan)
# Reproducibility
stations_meta()
citation('weathercan')
if(requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) devtools::session_info()
```
